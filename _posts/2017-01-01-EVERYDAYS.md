## EVERYDAYS
I recently started a series where I'll create a piece of artwork (motion graphics, 3d renders, animations, whatever else) every day. The aim of this project is to learn new technical and design skills with programs I'm experimenting with. It's a challenging but fun project.  

To see my every day artwork, click the grid icon in the top right of the screen.
